# CADe SIMU – Classic Control Projects

This repository contains a collection of classic electrical control circuits designed and simulated using **CADe SIMU**.  
Each project includes:
- Power circuit diagram
- Control circuit diagram
- Sequence description
- Timers & relay logic
- Media (screenshots/videos)

The projects demonstrate fundamental industrial control concepts such as forward/reverse motor operation, interlocking, protection components, and timing-based sequencing.

## 📁 Projects Included

### 1. **Washing Machine Motor – Forward/Reverse Control**
A complete power and control circuit for a washing machine motor performing continuous forward and reverse motion using timers, contactors, overload protection, and interlocking.

### 2. **3-Motor Traffic Light Simulation – Standard Light Sequencing**
Power and control circuits for 3 motors used to simulate red, yellow, and green traffic signals with equal-timed sequences controlled by timers and relay logic.
