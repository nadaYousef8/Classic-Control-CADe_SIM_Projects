# Traffic Light Simulation – 3 Motors, Standard Sequence

This project represents a classic control and power circuit built in **CADe SIMU** using **3 motors** to simulate the output of standard red, yellow, and green traffic lights.

Each motor represents one lamp, and the sequence is controlled through timers and relay logic.

---

## 🚦 Sequence Logic

The control sequence follows a standard timing-based cycle:

1. **Red**
2. **Yellow + Red**
3. **Green**
4. **Yellow**
5. **Red**

All lights operate with **equal timer durations** for simplicity and clarity.

## ⚡ Power Circuit Components
- Three motors (representing Red, Yellow, Green lights)
- Circuit breakers  
- Overload relays  
- Power wiring to each motor  

---

## 🧠 Control Circuit Logic
- **Timers** to manage equal-duration state transitions  
- **Relays** to activate the appropriate motor for each light  
- **Sequential switching** based on timer outputs  
- Simple and clear circuit flow for educational demonstration
